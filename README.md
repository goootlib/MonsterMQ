# MonsterMQ
MonsterMQ is a PHP implementation of AMQP client. It provides consumer and producer AMQP client variations with convenient and elegant API.
If you are already familiar with AMQP and RabbitMQ read on this manual, otherwise I would recommend to get started with reading this tutorial.
## Requirements
MonsterMQ intented for usage of 0.9.1 version of AMQP protocol, therefore it supports all RabbitMQ versions which support AMQP 0.9.1.
Also MonsterMQ requires PHP 7.1 or higher.
## Setup
To install the library use following composer command
```
composer require monstermq/monstermq
```
Then include composer autoloader in your script files to gain access to the library files
```
require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';
```
## Usage
The library provides two classes to work with.
The producer:
```
$producer = new \MonsterMQ\Client\Producer();
```
And the consumer:
```
$consumer = new \MonsterMQ\Client\Consumer();
```
Further we will examine all features provided by them.
### Common features
Both client variations provide following features:
- Network connection establishment with TLS or TCP.
- Session establishment with specified username and password.
- Exchange declarations.
- Queue declarations.
- Events management.
#### Network connection establishment
In order to connect to specified RabbitMQ server by TCP protocol first create producer or consumer instance and then call connect method with ip address, port number number of your RabbitMQ server. You may also specify connection timeout as a third argument of connect method.
```
$producer->connect('127.0.0.1', 5672, 10);
```
You may omit all arguments of **connect()** method. In this case MonsterMQ will try to connect to server on localhost with default port number (which is 5672).
#### Configuring network TCP connection
If you wish to cofigure your network connection you may use **network()** or **socket()** methods of consumer or producer instance. Both methods are the aliases to each other and provide access to the same programm module. Here are the methods they provide:
```
$consumer->socket()->bindTo(9999, '127.0.0.1')->enableNodelay()->disableKeepalive()
  ->setTimeout($seconds, $microseconds)->connect();
```
**bindTo($portNumber, $ipAddress)** - method binds MonsterMQ to specified port on specified network inteface, use this method if you wish to bind MonsterMQ to arbitary port number. Second argument (IP address) may be omitted, in this case IP address will be chosen automaticaly.

**enableNodelay()** - this method disables [Nagle's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm). It is enabled by default.

**disableKeepalive()** - this method disables [keepalive TCP feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keepalive).

**setTimeout($seconds, $microseconds)** - this method sets reading/writing timeout for network connection. You may specify first and second arguments of the method as integers representing the number of seconds and microseconds accordingly, after which connection will be closed if no reading or writing to the socket occurs. setTimeout() method also allows to pass only one argument which might be an integer or a float, if this sigle argument is float the fractional part of it will be treated as microseconds whereas the number before the floating point will be treated as seconds.

#### Configuring encrypted network connection
MonsterMQ allows to use encrypted connections using TLS protocol. In order to utilize and configure it, call the following methods:
```
$producer->network()->useTLS()->verifyPeer()->verifyPeerName()->peerName($name)
  ->CA($pathToCAFile)->certificate($pathToCertificateFile)
  ->privateKey($pathToPrivateKey)->password($password)
  ->verifyDepth($number)->ciphers($ciphers)->connect();
```
**useTLS()** - this method must be called to enable TLS.

**verifyPeer()** - this method must be called in order to enable peer verification. If you want only to use encryption without peer verification you may skip this method call.

**verifyPeerName()** - this method might be called in order to enable peer name verification, if you call this method you must also specify peer name by calling the peerName() method. Call to this method is not required if you don't want to verify name of remote peer certificate.

**peerName($name)** - specify peer name with this method when peer name verification enabled. Call to this method is not required if you don't want to verify name of remote peer certificate, or if you want that peer name will be automaticaly chosen based on the address argument of connect() method.

**CA($pathToCAFile)** - specify the path to Certificate Authority file with this method in order to be able to establish TLS connection.

**privateKey($pathToPrivateKey)** - specify the path to Private Key file with this method.

**password($password)** - specify the password with which your certificate was created. Call to this method is not required if your certficate was created without password.

**verifyDepth($number)** - specify the length of certificate chain after which verification will be aborted.
